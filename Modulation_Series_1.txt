[Series 1: Basic Concepts of Modulation]

1. What is modulation and why is it used in communications?
   Answer: It is the process of varying parameters of a carrier signal (such as amplitude, frequency, or phase) with the information signal.
           Used to efficiently transmit signals over communication channels and increase range.

2. Name the main types of analog modulation.
   Answer:
     - Amplitude Modulation (AM)
     - Frequency Modulation (FM)
     - Phase Modulation (PM)

3. What are the characteristics of a carrier signal?
   Answer: Usually a high-frequency sinusoidal wave whose amplitude, frequency, or phase is modified by the message signal.

4. How is bandwidth calculated in AM modulation?
   Answer: BW = 2 * f_m, where f_m is the highest frequency of the message signal.

5. Why does FM have less noise compared to AM?
   Answer: Because information is stored in frequency variations, and noise generally affects amplitude.
