[Series 4: Digital Modulation]

1. What is the difference between ASK and FSK?
   Answer:
     - ASK: Varies the carrier amplitude based on digital data.
     - FSK: Varies the carrier frequency based on digital data.

2. How does QAM modulation work?
   Answer: It combines two carrier signals with 90-degree phase difference to transmit more data.

3. Why is PSK less error-prone than ASK?
   Answer: Because phase changes are more resistant to noise than amplitude changes.

4. What is the advantage of digital modulation over analog?
   Answer: Higher noise immunity, error correction capabilities, and easier processing.

5. What is the application of OFDM modulation?
   Answer: Used in WiFi, LTE, and DSL due to resistance to multipath interference.
